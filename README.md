# OnePlat.DiceNotation
DiceNotation library written in .NET Standard to provide dice notation parsing, evaluation, and rolling.

Dice notation (also known as dice algebra, common dice notation, RPG dice notation, and several other titles) is a system to represent different combinations of dice in role-playing games using simple algebra-like notation such as 2d6+12.

The specification for the dice notation supported in the current version on the library is located [here](docs/DiceNotationSpecCurrent.md).
